Welcome to my Coding Portfolio

This a collection of my coding projects. Listed here are the larger projects I've completed as a part of development teams.
Inside "School Projects" are my smaller projects done through school coursework.

My favorite, largest, and most recent project is GameGrid, a video game forum application where users can create game portfolios
and share their reviews with friends. I was one of two backend developers who designed the APIs that made the site functional,
including the review feature. You should check it out!
